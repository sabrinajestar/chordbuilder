# chordbuilder

A modest tool to assist in song composition. 

Under development. When 1.0 is complete, the user will be able to construct and modify a chord progression, and see the chords displayed on a keyboard. 

Select a key root and scale, and use the chord builder to build the chord you want. Click "Add to Chord Progression" to add it to the progression. Chords in the progression will be movable and stretchable via drag-and-drop.

In future iterations, the user will be able to download the progression as a MIDI file, and also see notes on the harmonic and functional characteristics of the progression as it is being developed.

Built using Vue 3 and Vuetify. Runs locally with npm.
